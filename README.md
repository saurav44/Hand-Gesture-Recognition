# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
This a Deep Learning project to recognize the hand gestures during runtime using OpenCV. First we'll capture different hand gestures and split it into training and testing data. Then train Deep Learning model with these captured images and finally provided real time hand gestures, the model will predict it.
